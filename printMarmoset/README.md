Print Marmoset
==========
A Firefox plugin that allows users to select or remove regions of web pages using mouse gestures and re-layout the page for nice printout. This is done before the age of jQuery and the [good part of the javascript] (http://javascript.crockford.com) is broadly known. DOM manipulation was quite painful back then, but I tried some image processing using Javascript and the newly introduced "Canvas" element. See my
[ACM CHI' 09 paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518720) and a short [demo video](http://youtu.be/F0vbTG2FXVQ).
